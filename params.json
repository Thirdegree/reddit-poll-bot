Documentation is kept up-to-date\r\nin the source code. Here are some simple use case examples.\r\n\r\n###Creating a new bot and submission\r\nThis creates a new poll and automatically generates body text for the submission using the title, description, and candidates list.\r\n```python\r\nimport reddit_poll_bot\r\n\r\n# connect to reddit api\r\nbot = reddit_poll_bot.RedditPollBot(\"My poll bot's user-agent id\")\r\nbot.login('bot_username', 'bot_password')\r\n\r\n# create the poll\r\nsubreddit = 'aww'\r\ntitle = 'Vote for the cutest animal!'\r\ndescription = 'Which do you like best?'\r\ncandidates = ['dog', 'cat', 'lizard']\r\nbot.create_poll(subreddit, title, description, candidates)\r\n```\r\nOnce created, Reddit users may comment on the submission and place their vote by italicizing their \r\nchoice of candidate anywhere in their comment. This is done by surrounding their choice with \r\nasterisks. For example:\r\n```\r\nMy favorite animals are *lizard*s!\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Seeing intermittent poll results\r\nThe ```peek_votes()``` method of the Reddit Vote Bot can be used to unintrusively see results at any \r\ntime in the polling process. Below is an example where all valid choices and their current voting \r\nresults are printed.\r\n```python\r\n# define valid voting choices\r\ncandidates = ['dog', 'cat', 'lizard']\r\ntitle = 'Vote for the cutest animal!'\r\n\r\n# print each poll choice and its vote count\r\nfor candidate, count in bot.peek_votes(title, candidates).items():\r\n    print 'choice: ' + candidate + ' votes: ' + str(count)\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Ending a poll and posting the results\r\nReddit Vote Bot will automatically tally all of the votes and edit the submission for everyone to see. \r\nEntering the candidates list restricts accepted entries to those candidates.\r\n```python\r\n# count votes and post the results to the poll\r\ntitle = 'Vote for the cutest animal!'\r\ncandidates = ['dog', 'cat', 'lizard']\r\nbot.post_votes(title, candidates, show_winner=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Deleting a poll\r\nThis removes the poll submission from Reddit.\r\n```python\r\n# delete this poll forever\r\nbot.delete_poll('Vote for the cutest animal!')\r\n```","note":"Don't delete this file!
